class ReynoldsModel(FlockModel):
    """
    Setup the parameters for the Reynolds model simulation. The model simulates
    the behaviour of flocking birdoid objects (boids) in a 2D continuous space.
    In addition to the Vicsek model, the Reynolds model includes an aggegation
    and an avoidance parameter. The version used here is a simplified version of
    Reynold's [1] similar to the ones used by Seth [2] and Rosas et al [3], with
    boids behaving as particles with no mass, shape or dimension.

    The starting positions and velocities of boids are distributed uniformly at
    random.

    The position Xi of each boid i evolves as follows:

        Xi(t + dt) = Xi(t) + Vi(t) dt

    where the velocity Vi(t) is given by:

        Vi(t + dt) = Vi(t) + R1(i) + R2(i) + R3(i)

    where each of the three rules is regulated by scalar params a1, a2, a3.

    In the Reynolds model the neighbourhood is always metric and ignores certain
    angles aka (simulated perception). In this simplified version we use a
    convention from the Vicsek model, where metric neighbours are chosen with a
    parameter r that controls the range of the neighbourhood.
