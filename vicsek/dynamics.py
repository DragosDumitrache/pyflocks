class VicsekModel:
    """
    Setup the parameters for the Vicsek model simulation. The model simulates
    the behaviour of moving particles in a 2D continuous space. The only rule
    is: at each time step a given particle driven with a constant absolute
    velocity v assumes the average direction of motion of the particles in its
    neighborhood of radius r with some random perturbation E added.


    The position Xi of each particle i evolves as follows:

        Xi(t + dt) = Xi(t) + Vi(t) dt

    where the velocity Vi(t) is given by the absolute velocity v and angle Ai(t)
    which evolves as follows:

        Ai(t + i)  = <A(t)>(i, r) + dE
