class KuramotoFlock:
    """
    This simulation combines a Vicsek 2D particle model with a Kuramoto model of
    oscillators.

    At each time step a given particle driven with a constant absolute velocity
    v assumes the average direction of motion of the particles in its
    neighborhood of radius r with some random perturbation E added.

    The position Xi of each particle i evolves as follows:

        Xi(t + dt) = Xi(t) + Vi(t) dt

    where the velocity Vi(t) is given by the absolute velocity v and angle Ai(t)
    which evolves into the average angle <A(t)> of its neigbours:

        Ai(t + dt)  = <A(t)> + dE

    Driven Particles". Physical Review Letters. 75 (6): 1226â€“1229.
    https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0611743

    Moreover, each particle acts as an oscillator with frequency Fi, phase Pi.
    These oscillators are coupled with coupling parameter k if they are in
    proximity of each other, and the phase Pi of each oscillator evolves as:

        Pi(t + dt) = Pi + dP * dt

    where the phase difference dP comes from the angular frequency and the sum
    of angular differences with its neighbours weighted by the parameter k:

        dP = Fi * 2pi + k * sum(sin(Pi(t) - Pj(t))

    It is assumed that each oscillator has the same frequency f, but this can
    be easily amended through the use of the array F.

    For a description of the oscillator model see,  Kuramoto, Y. (1984).
