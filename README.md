# Library for simulating flocks

Currently implemented in Python. Use

```
python -m {model_name}.main --help
```

for information on simulation parameters, and run also with `python -m`.

Simulation results are stored in `out/txt`. If `--saveimg` param is set, plots
of the state of the simulation at each timestep are saved in `out/img`.

Use `./gif.sh` to turn all the images into animations of the model.
